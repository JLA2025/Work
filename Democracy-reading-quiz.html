        <div class="reading-content">
            <h3>Read the following passage:</h3>
            <p>Learning to ask deeper or different questions of the world is the purpose of studying in the university and elsewhere. In this spirit, I hope by the end of this chapter to convince you not to be an anti-democrat but to be a critical democrat.</p>
            
            <p>Official world opinion is very much in favour of democracy, which is seen as being not only an effective way to govern but a virtuous way to govern. Many ordinary people concur that democracy is a better way to be governed and assert the power of people in society to have a say in their country's future.</p>
            
            <p>Contrary to what is commonly assumed, the people who care most about democracy are not citizens of established democracies but those who endure authoritarianism and fight oppression. Often for them, democracy is not so much about voting but dignity and the capacity to be a political agent.</p>

            <p>When you study at university, you learn to ask better and deeper questions about the world. This chapter wants you to support democracy, but also to think carefully about it.</p>
            
            <p>Most people in the world think democracy is good. They believe it is not only a good way to run a country, but also the right way to do it. Many ordinary people agree that democracy is better than other systems. They want to have a voice in deciding their country's future.</p>
            
            <p>Most people think that citizens in democratic countries care most about democracy. But this is not true. The people who care most about democracy are those who live under bad governments and fight against them. For these people, democracy is not just about voting. It is about having dignity and being able to take part in politics.</p>

        <h2>Section 2: Argentina's Complex Democratic Journey</h2>
        <div class="reading-content">
            <h3>Read about Argentina's democratic development:</h3>
            <p>Argentina became independent of Spanish colonial rule in 1810, though as a settler colony this independence is considered hollow by many indigenous people who point to colonial continuities. In the nineteenth century, elite political struggles focused on nation-building. In the twentieth century, politics revolved around struggles for power, including the demand for political inclusion and greater social equality.</p>
            
            <p>Repudiation of these demands often resulted in military coups, of which Argentina suffered no fewer than five: 1930, 1943, 1955, 1966, 1976. However, Argentina's return to electoral democracy in 1983, in which human rights demands played a crucial role, has endured to today.</p>
            
            <p>The democracies that rule Latin America today, incomplete and troubled as they are, are nevertheless a source of pride for most Latin Americans and have certainly been hard won.</p>

            <p>Argentina became independent from Spain in 1810. However, many native people say this independence was not real because Spanish ideas and control continued. In the 1800s, important people fought about how to build the nation. In the 1900s, politics was about power struggles. People wanted to be included in politics and wanted more equal treatment.</p>
            
            <p>When the government refused these demands, the military often took control of the country. This happened five times: in 1930, 1943, 1955, 1966, and 1976. But in 1983, Argentina became a democracy again. People who wanted human rights helped make this happen. Argentina has been a democracy since then.</p>
            
            <p>The democracies in Latin America today are not perfect and have problems. But most Latin Americans are proud of them because they were difficult to achieve.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Understanding Populism -->
    <div class="section hidden" id="section3">
        <h2>Section 3: The Nature of Populism</h2>
        <div class="reading-content">
            <h3>Read about populism as a political phenomenon:</h3>
            <p>Populism is a form of government that combines electoral democracy with a cult of personality. Populism does not focus on a particular political agenda (populists can be left or right wing) but rather on a type of political relationship between a leader and the people.</p>
            
            <p>The populist leader often has a charismatic persona and 'performs' powerfulness through rhetoric and action. Gender roles are important to this image too because powerfulness, control and competence are associated with masculinity. Like many populist leaders, populists portray themselves as 'men of action' who won't let bureaucracy or elite interests stand in the way of helping the poor.</p>
            
            <p>In some ways, populism seems anti-democratic because it empowers a single charismatic leader and solidifies hierarchies like class and gender, rather than dismantling them. However, leaders are nothing without the mass of people to support them, and examples of successful populism are driven by the demands and desires of people who feel overlooked, disadvantaged and disparaged.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="simplified-content">
            <div class="simplified-header">Levelled:</div>
            <p>Populism is a type of government that mixes democracy with strong worship of a leader. Populism is not about specific political ideas (populist leaders can be left-wing or right-wing). Instead, it is about the special relationship between a leader and the people.</p>
            
            <p>Populist leaders are usually very attractive and charming. They show their power through speaking and actions. Gender roles are important here because people connect power, control and ability with being masculine. Populist leaders show themselves as 'men of action' who will not let government rules or rich people stop them from helping poor people.</p>
            
            <p>In some ways, populism seems anti-democratic because it gives power to one charming leader. It makes differences between social classes and men and women stronger, instead of removing these differences. However, leaders need many people to support them. Successful populism happens when people who feel ignored, disadvantaged and looked down upon want change.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Juan and Eva Perón -->
    <div class="section hidden" id="section4">
        <h2>Section 4: The Peróns and Gender Roles in Populism</h2>
        <div class="reading-content">
            <h3>Read about Juan and Eva Perón:</h3>
            <p>Juan Perón had a magnetic personality and gave brilliant speeches. He 'performed' his connection to ordinary people by taking off his jacket and rolling up his sleeves, by playing sports and emphasising his recent immigrant past. He made use of a masculine image as a father figure, a role that makes dominance seem natural, protective and legitimate.</p>
            
            <p>His paternalistic and macho persona was reinforced by the femininity of his wife, Eva Duarte. Evita was a hugely charismatic person in her own right, whose greatest part as an actress was to 'perform' her roles of humble provincial girl, glamorous fashionista and mother of the poor. She was simultaneously ordinary and extraordinary, conveying the idea that she knew how hard a life of poverty could be, but now occupied a place of power from where she could 'change the world'.</p>
            
            <p>Evita also performed the role of dutiful wife, declaring her unconditional support for her husband and urging the working class to trust in Perón, the father-figure, as she did. By playing up to these idealised gender roles, Juan and Eva Perón legitimised their powerfulness and won the hearts of the people.</p>

            <p>Juan Perón was very attractive to people and gave excellent speeches. He showed that he was connected to ordinary people by removing his jacket and rolling up his sleeves, playing sports, and talking about his immigrant background. He used a masculine image as a father figure. This made his control seem natural, protective and right.</p>
            
            <p>His fatherly and masculine personality was made stronger by his wife Eva Duarte's feminine behaviour. Evita was very charming. As an actress, she played roles of a simple country girl, a glamorous fashion lover, and a mother of poor people. She was both ordinary and extraordinary. She showed that she understood how hard life was for poor people, but now she had power to 'change the world'.</p>
            
            <p>Evita also acted as a good wife. She said she supported her husband completely and told working-class people to trust Perón like she did. By using these perfect gender roles, Juan and Eva Perón made their power seem right and won people's hearts.</p>

        <div class="reading-content">
            <h3>Read about clientelism in Argentine politics:</h3>
            <p>Perón distributed national wealth more evenly and raised poor people's standard of living. However, these state welfare benefits were often channelled through the Peronist party machine. Benefits are not so much 'rights', then, as 'politicised favours'.</p>
            
            <p>Known as clientelism, this system channels goods, services, opportunities, money, benefits and jobs through the Peronist patron–client networks. The party has a network of activists who distribute social welfare and benefits through grassroots offices that act as community centres. They host pensioners' lunches and weekend barbecues as well as party meetings.</p>
            
            <p>While distributing such welfare has a tangible and positive impact on poor people's lives, it undermines a core principle of democracy – equality – because benefits are not distributed evenly to everyone because they are citizens (rights), but unevenly and to a few because they are Peronist supporters (favours).</p>

            <p>Perón shared the country's wealth more equally and improved poor people's lives. However, these government benefits were often given through the Peronist party organisation. So benefits were not really 'rights' for all people, but 'political favours' for some people.</p>
            
            <p>This system is called clientelism. It gives goods, services, opportunities, money, benefits and jobs through Peronist networks.

        <div class="reading-content">
            <h3>Read about Argentina's human rights movement:</h3>
            <p>The last military dictatorship of 1976–83 was one of the most brutal in Latin America, ordering the abduction, murder and disappearance of around 30,000 people whom it understood to be enemies of the Argentine nation. The climate of fear was so intense that very few spoke out against the dictatorship, but the most vocal of those were the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo.</p>
            
            <p>The Madres are the mothers of the young people who were 'disappeared' by the military government. They met once a week in Buenos Aires' main square where the presidential palace, cathedral and government ministries are located. Here they walked around the central obelisk in quiet yet powerful condemnation of the military government.</p>
            
            <p>Their third significant contribution to democracy in Argentina was to demonstrate that social movements of ordinary people could transform political life. They brought new political actors – and therefore new ideas – to the fore and therefore democratised the political stage.</p>

            <p>From 1976 to 1983, Argentina had a very cruel military government. This government kidnapped, killed, and made about 30,000 people disappear because they thought these people were enemies. People were very scared, so most people did not speak against the military government. But the Madres (Mothers) de la Plaza de Mayo were the loudest protesters.</p>
            
            <p>The Madres were mothers whose children had 'disappeared' because of the military government. Every week, they met in the main square of Buenos Aires.

The mothers walked around a monument in the square to protest against the military government in a quiet but strong way.</p>

            <h3>Read about contemporary populism:</h3>
            <p>Like Perón, Trump has built a fervent constituency of support based on classic populist motifs. Despite being a billionaire, he portrays himself as a 'man of the people' who wears baseball caps and talks like an 'average Joe'. His immense charisma can turn fantasy into truth and non-logical arguments into compelling rhetoric, through which he embodies hope, dignifies the excluded and promises action.</p>
            
            <p>The key target of his populist rhetoric is the disadvantaged and impoverished white working class. These are his 'real People' whose livelihoods and values no longer fit an America they feel has been betrayed by Washington and they wish to see 'great again'. He lines up the 'others' of this People – the liberal elite, the immigrant, the Muslim terrorist – and offers easy solutions to American problems.</p>
            
            <p>Comparing Trump to Perón we can see that despite their very different political orientations, backgrounds and epochs, there are many similarities in the way that they build and configure their connection to the mass support base. This demonstrates that populism is a relationship, not an ideology. It can enhance democracy by giving a voice to the excluded, but the leader-masses hierarchy it engenders promotes authoritarian manipulation.</p>

            <p>Like Perón, Trump has built strong support using classic populist methods. Even though he is a billionaire, he shows himself as a 'man of the people' who wears baseball caps and talks like an ordinary person. His great charm can make fantasy seem like truth and weak arguments seem strong. Through this, he gives hope, makes excluded people feel important, and promises action.</p>

            <p>When we compare Trump to Perón, we can see they are very different in their political beliefs, backgrounds and time periods. But there are many similarities in how they build and organise their connection to mass support. This shows that populism is a relationship, not a set of ideas. It can help democracy by giving a voice to excluded people, but the hierarchy between leader and masses encourages authoritarian control.</p>

            <p>One of the key assumptions buried deep within conventional understandings of democracy is that the best democracies are in the West.

            <p>This means that Western democracies are already set-up to 'succeed' by these criteria while the others are pre-destined to fail or are portrayed as playing catch-up. The word 'democratic' is not value-neutral. It has a silent tag 'good' attached to it, and the label 'non-democratic' is therefore silently tagged with the word 'bad' or at least 'dubious'.</p>
            
            <p>Beginning our thinking from Argentina and not the USA disrupts our assumptions about what is 'normal' practice in a democracy and it questions the super-valuation of political practice in 'developed' democracies. It helps to break through the presumption that the USA has got democracy 'right' and that others simply need to follow suit.</p>

            <p>This means that Western democracies are already set up to 'succeed' by these measures, while others are expected to fail or are shown as trying to catch up. The word 'democratic' is not neutral. It has a hidden 'good' label attached to it. The label 'non-democratic' therefore has a hidden 'bad' or 'suspicious' label.</p>
            
            <p>Starting our thinking from Argentina instead of the USA changes our assumptions about what is 'normal' practice in democracy. It questions the high value placed on political practice in 'developed' democracies. It helps break the assumption that the USA has got democracy 'right' and that others simply need to copy it.</p>

        <h2>Section 10: Democratising Our Understanding of Democracy</h2>
        <div class="reading-content">
            <h3>Read the author's conclusion:</h3>
            <p>Is democracy a good idea, then? In the end, for me, the answer to the question is yes. I think that democracy seeks to enact political ideals that I find crucial and that are shared by a wide range of cultures and societies. However, I think that we need to democratise our understanding of democracy.</p>
            
            <p>One of the key problems with what we call democracy is the way that it has been hitched to the political systems of powerful countries, wrapped up in a moral lesson about the way that societies ought to be. One of the things that we can do when we are thinking about democracy, then, is to make these value judgements visible and problematise them.</p>
            
            <p>There is no one way to be democratic, and in my view a plurality of ideas, voices, and cultural understandings can enrich all our democracies, even those that are longest established. If we want to look for ways to broaden or deepen democracy, then, we should look to the social realm and imagine democracy as not just a way to choose decision-makers but a way of life.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="simplified-content">
            <div class="simplified-header">Levelled:</div>
            <p>So, is democracy a good idea? For me, the answer is yes. I think democracy tries to create important political ideas that I believe in. Many cultures and societies around the world share these ideas. However, I think we need to make our understanding of democracy more democratic.</p>
            
            <p>One big problem with what we call democracy is that it has been connected to the political systems of powerful countries. These countries teach moral lessons about how societies should be. When we think about democracy, we should make these value judgements clear and question them.</p>
            
            <p>There is not just one way to be democratic. I believe that many different ideas, voices, and cultural understandings can make all our democracies better, even the oldest ones. If we want to find ways to improve democracy, we should look at the social world and think of democracy not just as a way to choose leaders, but as a way of life.</p>
